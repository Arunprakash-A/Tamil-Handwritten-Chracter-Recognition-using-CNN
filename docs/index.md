# Tamil Handwritten Character Recogniton Model
Tamil Handwritten character recognition using convolutional neural networks.
## Dataset: IWFHR-10 
![Data Distribution](https://github.com/Arunprakash-A/Tamil-Handwritten-Chracter-Recognition-using-CNN/blob/master/Output/trainDistribution.png?raw=True)
* We can observe that there is a slight class imbalance (i.e., some classes have more training samples over other classes) problem
